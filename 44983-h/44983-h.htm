<p class="h2number"><span class="white">&nbsp;ONE&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
<span class="largecap2">N</span>ONE of the Allied Nations has had more or greater
problems confronting it than Italy has. Manpower
has not been lacking, but the want of raw
materials for the making of munitions has been a
serious handicap, and one that has been most difficult to
overcome. Italy has been absolutely dependent upon her
allies for steel and coal. After her declaration
of war against Germany, she was left
helpless. Badly as France and England
needed these raw materials, they had to
come to the assistance of their ally. For
a long time the quantities received were
insufficient, and a sustained offensive
against Austria was impossible, for want
of ammunition.
</p>

<p>
This condition was greatly improved
when the United States entered the war,
and Italy received from us vast quantities
of steel, and sufficient coal came from
England to supply her needs.
</p>

<p>
It must be borne in mind that when war
was declared (August 1, 1914) practically
all the industrial and commercial organizations
in Italy were controlled by Germany.
The largest banks and financial houses
were German-owned. One of the most
prolific sources of income, the electric and
other plants operated by water-power,
were in German hands.
</p>

<p>
Germany had a firm grip on the resources
of the country. Her agents carried on a
propaganda which required the utmost
courage of the Italians to overcome, and
let it be said to the credit of the Italian
people, they risked financial ruin when
they decided to enter the war on the side
of the Allies.
</p>

<p>
The first result of their entry into the
World War was to demoralize their securities
and almost to destroy the value of
their money. The <i>lira</i>, a coin which, before
the war, was worth about 19 cents,
decreased in buying power to about 11
cents. Bonds dropped alarmingly.
</p>

<p>
With the United States as an ally, loans
have been made to Italy, her credit has
been re-established, the <i>lira</i> has gradually
increased in value, and with steel and coal
in sufficient quantities for all purposes,
prosperity is returning.
</p>

<p>
It was the shrewd Bismarck who
arranged with Signor Crispi, twice Premier,
to come to the assistance of Italy. A loan
was made, and the best Italian securities
were obtained for a song. Ever since, the
German grip has tightened. As a result
of the war Italy will be restored to commercial
freedom and she will have a new
and much needed opportunity to expand.
</p>

<p>
The Ansaldo Company, a new and
gigantic corporation, is now one of the
largest munition plants in the world.
Italy has tremendous resources in her
water-power which is now being developed.
Like her allies, she will be able to
manufacture many of the things she
needs.
</p>

<p>
Her airplanes are among the best that
are made. Her engines are wonders of
mechanical perfection. Her motor cars
are unexcelled. Italy, prepared as she
never was, is ready for the future.

<p class="h2number"><span class="white">&nbsp;TWO&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
<span class="largecap2">H</span>OW to keep the soldiers supplied with sufficient nourishing
food was one of the first and most serious
matters the Italian Government had to consider.
As everyone knows, the principal articles of
food consumption among Italians of every station, rich or
poor, are macaroni and spaghetti. The staff of life of the
Italian people, they are made almost entirely
of flour.
</p>

<p>
Italy never has grown enough wheat to
supply her needs. Under war conditions
her imports fell to such an extent that little
or no wheat could be obtained. Hence
the country faced a critical situation.
</p>

<p>
The first step was conservation. It was
ruled that macaroni and spaghetti could
be served only on certain days. Manufacturers
were restricted in the amount they
could make. Then flours of mixed cereals
were used.
</p>

<p>
Italians are great lovers of bread. To
meet a shortage, every available acre of
ground where wheat would grow was cultivated.
If the men on the farm had gone
to war, the women took their places. The
Government encouraged and aided the
farmers in every possible way, and then
when aid came from the United States, in
addition to sacrifices and restrictions in
Italy, the situation improved.
</p>

<p>
Fruit and vegetables are plentiful and,
for these times, reasonably cheap. Italians
are not great meat-eaters; they have
sufficient meat for their needs, and by
adhering rigidly to the regulations they
have been able to keep the army fully
supplied.
</p>

<p>
The Adriatic and the Mediterranean
abound with fish of almost every variety.
Fishermen are therefore able to meet the
country's needs. Next to macaroni and
spaghetti the Italians like fish, and as it
is far cheaper than meat, for the poorer
classes it forms a food which they can
afford to buy.
</p>

<p>
Olive oil, formerly used in great quantities,
many of the people even drinking it,
is now on the restricted list, and can be
obtained only in limited quantities.
</p>

<p>
Bread, as in America, is mixed with
other cereals, and for civilians practically
no white bread can be obtained. In the
army, there are no restrictions&mdash;the best
of food is given to the soldiers. They obtain
meat, butter, milk, sugar and other
edibles denied wholly or in part to civilians.
</p>

<p>
As in France, wine is a part of the regular
rations. Various welfare organizations
see that the people do not suffer for
want of food. Irrigation and intensive
farming, in which representatives of all
classes are now helping, is aiding in the
solution of the food problem.

<i>Educational Conditions</i>
</p>
</div>

<p class="h2number"><span class="white">&nbsp;THREE&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
<span class="largecap2">W</span>AR did not seriously interfere with the grammar
and high schools throughout Italy. It is in the higher
schools, such as the universities, the medical colleges
and in the technical schools that a changed
condition is seen. Women came to the aid of the country
in the crisis which called so many men to the colors. Many of
the teachers in the elementary schools are
women and girls, who are ably taking the
places of the men whose positions were
made vacant.
</p>

<p>
For the schools where higher education
is taught, it is quite a different and more
complex problem. To teach in a university
or in a medical college certain qualifications
are absolutely essential. Years of
study and preparation are needed, and for
this work but a limited number of women
were available.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the necessities of war
called to action thousands of young men
who otherwise would have attended the
various schools for higher education. As
a result the number of students in practically
all of these schools has fallen off
materially, and there has not been the need
for so many professors.
</p>

<p>
The Government is anxious not to discourage
higher education; in fact, it is doing
all it can to maintain it, as was evident
in the establishment of the Camp Universities.
It was inevitable that the attendance
at the higher schools could not be maintained
as in peace time, and the reduction
in the number of pupils fortunately made
possible a corresponding diminution of
teachers.
</p>

<p>
By a system which permitted the return
of professors in service at the front, although
only for a limited period, the
efficiency of the various universities and
colleges was continued through the war.
Students co-operated with the Government,
some even giving up their furloughs
to attend school.
</p>

<p>
Education for the youth of the land is
still compulsory. The standard of wages
among teachers remains very low, and out
of proportion to the increased cost of living,
but the recipients seem willing to sacrifice
comfort for the general good.
</p>

<p>
Old men, who in their youth taught
school, volunteered to return to a labor of
love. It was this spirit which made possible
the maintenance of education. Italy
is a poor country, but her sons and daughters
are eager to learn, and, poor as they
are, they are willing to make sacrifices
rather than give up attending school.
</p>

<p>
Many of the art students are gone, and
some of the schools are closed. Beppo
the model is no longer to be found on the
steps of the Piazza Espagne, but the love
of art has sufficed to keep some of the art
schools going, no matter how rigorous the
conditions.
</p>

<p>
Music is in the soul of the Italian, and
the conservatories will continue in session
as long as there is a pupil left. On the
whole, educational conditions are as good
as present-day circumstances will permit.

<p class="h2number"><span class="white">&nbsp;FOUR&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
<span class="largecap2">W</span>HEN Italy entered the war, a commission was immediately
appointed by the Government to consider
measures for the protection of the country's art
treasuries. Under the direction of the curators of
galleries and museums, a civil engineer or architect was placed
in charge of each principal building in all the art centers of
northern Italy. The persons so appointed
set about devising individual means
adapted to the shielding of walls, towers,
statues and pictures from attack by air
and water, from shell and fire. In Venice
the chief works and structures selected for
protection were the Doges' (Dukes') Palace,
with its rich arcades, sculptured
façade and splendid halls, the superb
Church of St. Mark, the medieval Loggetta,
or vestibule, on the east side of the
Campanile, the Church of St. John and
St. Paul, the San Rocco School, the noble
equestrian statue known as the Colleoni
Monument, and the Academy of Fine
Arts, with its canvases by Bellini, Carpaccio,
Palma Vecchio, Tintoretto and
Titian.
</p>

<p>
At Padua, Donatello's equestrian monument
of Gattamelata, erected in 1453, and
the sepulchral church of St. Anthony of
Padua received special care; likewise the
Gate of the Scaligeri, Verona; the early
Renaissance Colleoni Chapel and some precious
frescoes at Bergamo; Leonardo da
Vinci's immortal canvas, "The Last Supper,"
in the refectory of the abbey-church
of Santa Maria della Grazie at Milan; the
Fountain of Neptune and the Church of San
Petronio at Bologna; the early Christian edifice
of San Vitale, the Mausoleum of Galla
Placidia (a queen of the fifth century) and
the Tomb of Dante, in the deserted old
city of Ravenna; and at Cremona, in the
Church of Sant' Agostino, the famously
beautiful altar-piece of the Madonna and
Two Saints, by Perugino. The most renowned
works of art in Rome, including
the statue of Caesar in the Capitoline
Museum, were padded and boarded up,
and from Firenze and Naples rare examples
of Italian craftsmanship, guarded
through the centuries&mdash;manuscripts, statuary,
paintings, tapestries, metalware,
mosaics, glass&mdash;were carried away to safety,
some of them to the vaults of the Uffizi
Gallery in Florence.
</p>

<p>
Titian's masterpiece, the "Assumption
of the Virgin," was laboriously removed
from the Academy of Fine Arts at Venice
and transported by boat and wagon to a
place of security against attack by the
Vandals. Tintoretto's "Paradise," the
largest oil painting in the world (72 feet
by 23 feet) was unframed and removed
from the wall of the Hall of the Great
Council in the Palace of the Doges. Ceiling
paintings were taken down, rolled
around great sticks thirty inches in diameter,
hermetically sealed in copper cylinders,
and stored in crypts to rest until the
joyous day of their unrolling. Altogether,
seven thousand square yards of canvas
were thus protected from attack and pillage.
Statues were wrapped in mattresses
and covered by brick flooring; the beloved
horses above the doorway of St. Mark's
were lowered and taken away. Domes
were roofed at an angle of sixty degrees,
so that aerial bombs would glance harmlessly
off. In the defence of Venetian art
treasures alone, sixty men worked for
three months to wall in everything delicate
and beautiful.
</p>

<p>
"Even Rheims and Louvain could not
offer such tempting morsels to the vandal
wrecker as Venice and Rome," writes
Herbert Vivian in "Italy at War." "Venice,
mistress of medieval art as well as
queen of the sea, girded her armor on,&mdash;like
the army, donned a vesture of gray-green.
Just as in Holy Week the more signal
emblems veil themselves in respectful
mourning for the Passion, so, in war time,
the monuments of Venice hide in their
hoods, as though to proclaim sympathy
with the nation's anxiety. At St. Mark's
... the venerated mosaics on the lunettes
are blotted out by modern masonry, the
golden cupolas are shapeless bags, the pillars
and arches have become a brick fortress
that goes on to engulf all that fairy
portico of the Doges' Palace hard by.
Where are the four famous horses of
golden bronze, brought from Constantinople
to defy the world through seven
centuries from the portals of St. Marks?
It was a sad scene when on May 27, 1915,
a silent crowd watched their descent for
conveyance to a safer stable. In the interior
of the holy house heaps and heaps
of heavy sandbags huddle against the
porphyries and malachites and alabasters,
throttle the carved columns, scale walls,
bury pulpit, choir, altars and baptistery.
Such are the bulwarks which Italian foresight
provided against probable forays of
the Hun."

<p>
<span class="largecap2">I</span>N time of peace all the world flocked to Venice. In
war time many changes were necessary. Many of the
people who make up the inhabitants of the earth
were barred from the city, not only by regulations,
but by cannon and walls of steel. It required influence even
for an Italian to get into Venice. For an American to enter the
city, it was necessary to get special permission
from the Minister of Marine, and
he had to present the best of reasons before
that permission was granted.
</p>

<p>
Several times the city was menaced by
the Austrians and once it was near capture.
Time and again, fleets of airplanes
dropped bombs, destroying churches, hospitals
and other property, as well as killing
non-combatants.
</p>

<p>
The strain was more than many of the
inhabitants could bear and they sought
safety in flight. The result was almost to
drain the city of its normal population,
which was evident in its almost deserted
canals and streets.
</p>

<p>
The soft, musical voices of the gondoliers
were occasionally heard. A few gondolas
were left, but very few, and there was
no longer any singing. The beautiful hotels,
where so many of us had lived in
comfort and luxury, were either closed or
converted into hospitals.
</p>

<p>
Most of the shops around St. Mark's
Square closed. The famous glass and lace
factories shut their doors. Picture postcards
and photographs were taboo. The
Government did not permit them to be
mailed.
</p>

<p>
No damage has been done to the Basilica
of St. Mark. A bomb dropped in
front of it, but did not hit it. During the
war this famous temple was, however, but
a shadow of its former glory. It no longer
glistened with Byzantine mosaic. Its
golden covering was removed or covered
with sandbags. Beside the Doges' Palace
was a thing of brick supports, destroying
its beauty. The ugliness of boarding and
sandbags saddened the visitor who recalled
the Venice of former days.
</p>

<p>
Motor and passenger boats plying along
the Grand Canal were discontinued; there
were no passengers. A few ferries remained
for those who still lived in the city.
</p>

<p>
Venice has not been seriously marred.
Much damage has been done to churches
and hospitals, but most of this can be
repaired. Only a careful search of the
city would reveal the damage done by
bombardment.
</p>

<p>
Within a few churches and buildings
art objects have been destroyed that can
never be replaced. It should comfort the
lovers of Venice to know that the city
gives no outward evidence of destruction.
The inhabitants will soon return, the hotels
will reopen, St. Mark's and the Doges'
Palace will be restored to their former
appearance, and Venice will once again
reign in splendor as the Queen of the
Adriatic.

<p>
<span class="largecap2">R</span>OME still sits proudly on her seven hills, undismayed,
undisturbed by the ravages of war. There is little
real difference to be seen in the Italian capital as it
is and as it was before the war. In the evening
hours, when all Rome goes for a promenade or a drive, the
Corso is as crowded as ever. One sees more uniforms, but
otherwise the scene is similar to that of
peace times.
</p>

<p>
Romans still love to dine on the sidewalks,
partake of their ices, and sip their
wine and coffee at little tables placed
where pedestrians are supposed to pass.
They attend the theater, the opera and
the various other places of amusement of
which they are so fond.
</p>

<p>
The main difference in the city's aspect
is in the dress of the people. Officers are
seen only in field uniform, privates in the
gray of the battle-field. Women no longer
attempt display, only the simplest effects
are seen. All ostentation in the wearing
of gowns and jewelry is frowned upon.
</p>

<p>
None has suffered more than the nobility.
Most of them being of moderate
means, the war brought many sacrifices,
endangering slender purses and curtailing
most needed comforts. A number
have had to sell their prized art treasures
to keep from actual want.
</p>

<p>
The beautiful Palace on the Quirinal is
now a hospital. Many of its nurses are
the noble women of Italy. The city is
filled with welfare organizations.
</p>

<p>
Buried in the heart of Rome, its ruins
telling us the story of the birth of civilization,
lies the Forum, unchanged, unaffected
by the world struggle. It speaks of days
that were, of other wars, of Caesar, who,
like the Kaiser, was ambitious, of Marc
Antony who sacrificed everything for love
of a woman, of Cicero, and others whose
deeds and words have made history.
</p>

<p>
Above the ruins of the Forum is the
Palatine. Here once lived the Caesars.
Their palaces once covered the hill from
which they looked down upon Rome. The
Golden Palace of Nero has been obliterated
by time, just as the chateaus and
beautiful structures of northern France
have been leveled by the invading Germans.
</p>

<p>
Fortunate is the world that the treasures
of Rome are intact. St. Peter's and
all the wonderful churches still stand unharmed.
The Vatican with its storehouse
of treasures remains as it was. Art galleries
containing world's masterpieces are
preserved for posterity.
</p>

<p>
Rome is still the Rome familiar to travelers.
Its hotels are filled, not with tourists,
but with officers and their families.
Its streets are still throbbing with life, it
remains one of the most interesting cities
on this spinning globe.

has played a far more important part in the World
War than is apparent to one who has not given the subject
special consideration. The neutral nations have directed most
of their thoughts to England and France. To do Italy full
justice, the fact must be emphasized that she came into the
war at a time when the Allies were in great need of her. The outlook for
England and France was most serious when the Italian people, roused by
love of liberty and democracy, demanded that their Government cast its
lot with the Allies and declare war.
</p>

<p>
As a result, Austria was compelled to mobilize and mass her forces
on the Italian frontier, and she was no longer able to give aid and
support to the Germans on the western front. The entire course of the
war was then materially changed.

<p>
Austria's army and navy were
thereafter kept busy trying to
hold the Italians in check. What
happened in the fall of 1917 will
always be more or less of a mystery.
After two years of the
hardest kind of fighting, during
which time the Austrians were
being gradually pushed back until
Vienna itself was threatened, there
came a retreat, one of the most
disastrous in the annals of war.
The Italians lost in two weeks all
that they had gained in two
years. Worse still, Italy was
invaded and a considerable area
occupied by the Austrian army.
</p>

<p>
Consternation ensued, the Italian people were dazed. Something
had gone wrong; no one could understand it. But one thing every
Italian knew, and that was that no braver soldiers were to be found
in any country, and that when Italy had time to recover from her
surprise Austria would pay the price.

<i>How the Italian Army Came Back</i>

<p>
The retreat of the Italian army was followed by a wave of patriotism
that swept from one end of Italy to the other. If there were some that
were lukewarm before, they were roused to the highest pitch of enthusiasm
for the prosecution of the war. Italy had
been invaded, and that was sufficient to
stir the blood of every Italian.
</p>

<p>
When, in the spring of 1918, Austria
launched her great offensive, she faced an
army wholly changed. Indifference had
vanished, every man thirsted for revenge.
No Italian would breathe freely until the
stain of the retreat was wiped out. Not an
Austrian must remain on Italian soil. The
Austrians were bewildered when, instead of
encountering a demoralized and beaten
army, they found themselves face to face
with a new and rejuvenated force.
</p>

<p>
Instead of advancing, the Austrians were
swept off their feet. Instead of a crumbling
line, they met a wall of steel against
which their onslaughts were of no avail.
On came the infuriated Italians, crushing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_3' name='Page_3'>[3]</a></span>
the Austrian offensive and forcing them to beat a hasty retreat. Austria
will never forget the punishment she received on the Piave (pee-ah-vuh),
along the Asiago plateau, and in the vicinity of Monta Grappa.
</p>

<p>
Fields were strewn with Austrian dead. So precipitate had been their
flight that they had to abandon guns, ammunition, supplies, in fact everything
they possessed. When, a few days later, I crossed the delta of the
Piave, I saw thousands of Austrian helmets, overcoats, and supplies of every
description covering the ground that extended
for many miles to the Little Piave, across
which the Austrian army had been driven.
</p>

<p>
It had been impossible in their retreat to
bury their dead. Heaps of bodies still lay
where they fell. Every ditch was filled with
slain Austrians, the roadways were lined with
them. It was a gruesome sight, but it told
the story of a changed Italy, of a new army
that meant to retrieve the honor of the
country, and bring to the Italian arms the
glory to which they were entitled.
</p>

<p>
Italy needed coal, she wanted steel for
ammunition, and these deficiencies threatened
her effort. Her allies came to her assistance,
and equipped and replenished her for the prosecution
of the war to a successful conclusion.

<p>
In relief work the Italians are particularly
efficient. The central organization of the Italian Red Cross has
naturally assumed the responsibility
and direction of all relief work, both
for soldiers and civilians. Numerous
other organizations have sprung into
existence; chief among them is "<i>Le
Samaritane</i>," which is under the presidency
of Her Majesty, Queen Helena
of Italy. In this organization are
thousands of women who are members
of the best Italian society, and
they have rendered effective and
generous assistance in many ways,
relieving distress wherever they find it.
</p>

<p>
A hospital for wounded soldiers
has been established at the Royal
Palace of the Quirinal, which is under
the direct supervision of the Queen.
The Duchess of Aosta, wife of the
King's cousin, is General Inspector of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4'>[4]</a></span>
the Red Cross nurses, and both of
these noble ladies give actual, effective,
and intelligent service to the
various relief organizations to which
their names are attached.

<p>
Italian women have proved themselves
worthy mates and daughters
of the heroic sons and soldiers of Italy.
To them is due the initiative in the
forming of several patriotic organizations,
such as the "White Cross,"
for the protection of little children,
"The Sowers of Courage," and
"The Smile to the Strong," formed
for helping and encouraging the fighting sons of Italy. Soldiers' huts
have been erected and put in charge of the members of an association
known as "Soldiers' Mammas." The members are women that have
sons at the front, and may therefore be expected to give affectionate and
maternal care to the young soldiers. There are other organizations, such
as "The Mothers of Fallen Soldiers" and "The Widows of the War,"
whose object is mutual help among the women that have suffered the loss
of son or husband.
</p>

<p>
Men who, because of advanced age, have been compelled to remain at
home, have not failed to take up the burden of assistance and relief.
Local committees have everywhere been formed under the name of
"<i>Assistenza Civile</i>." There is also the "<i>Segratariato del Popolo</i>," besides
many others. All these societies are banded together to assist the families
of soldiers, to care for the mutilated, and to aid wherever help is needed.
</p>

<p>
The Italian Government
has enacted special laws for the
benefit of those stricken by the
war. For instance, the Government
furnishes shoes below
cost to Government employees
earning less than four thousand
<i>lire</i> per year (about $800).

<h3>
<i>Education</i>
</h3>

<p>
School life continues practically
as in normal times, with
the exception that, in the elementary
schools and in the
grades of the grammar and
high schools, there is a larger
proportion of women teachers.
Many instructors who had been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5'>[5]</a></span>
retired have asked to re-enter service, thus relieving the young men
called to the colors.
</p>

<p>
In the universities a few distinguished professors of military age have
been permitted to retain their chairs, but a considerable number have gone
to the front. Naturally the number of students has been greatly reduced.
</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:212px;">

</div>

<p>
Special dispensations have been made for the schools of medicine, so
that the services of the more advanced students may be utilized while
at the same time they are enabled to continue their studies. This
has been made possible by the establishment of the so-called "<i>Universita
Castrense</i>," or Camp University, situated in the war zone, where distinguished
physicians who are also university professors teach the young
students, while teachers and pupils alternate the hours of class with those
of service in the camp hospitals. The change caused by the war in the
condition of women has probably been
more profound and more keenly felt in Italy
than in other countries, such as England and
France, where women have for many years
been engaged in various useful pursuits. In
Italy the women of the middle class, with
rare exceptions, remained at home. Those
of the lower class, when they worked at all,
generally chose some occupation such as
teaching. Most women had no economic
independence. Unmarried girls usually lived
with their parents or some married brother
or sister.

<p>
An ardent group of Italian women prepared
the ground and labored for years to
convince their sisters that they were wrong
in the belief that under all conditions "a
woman's place is in her home." This belief
was almost a religion in the southern
provinces of Italy; the prejudice
there was so strong that it required
the utmost courage of the women to
combat it. Intelligent, progressive and
cultured Italian girls are now to be
found in almost every occupation in
which their English, French and American
sisters are engaged. This revolution
in the attitude of Italian women
is accepted, not as a temporary war
necessity, but as a permanent change
that cannot fail to have a deep
and, on the whole, beneficent effect
upon social conditions in Italy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6'>[6]</a></span>
</p>

<h3>
<i>Food Regulations</i>
</h3>

<p>
Conditions in civil life are
comparatively good. Of
course, there are many restrictions,
above all in food conservation
and supply. Prices
have increased, but so have
salaries. There are no unemployed,
and the working classes
generally are prosperous.
</p>

<p>
War conditions required
three meatless days per week,
as in the other countries of the
Allies. Cards were given for
bread, sugar, coal, olive oil,
macaroni and rice. That the
quantity allowed to each individual
was sufficient was proved
by the fact that the authorities
often received offers to
diminish the rations of some
families who found they had
more than they needed. The use
of gas was limited to meal hours
for heating, and for illumination
until ten o'clock at night.
</p>

<p class="caption">Ceiling showing

</p>
</div>

<p>
No restrictions were placed
on the use of electricity in most
city homes, although street illumination
was diminished and
in certain cities in the advanced
zone was abolished entirely, as a defensive measure. The abundance of
electricity is explained by the fact that it is very often generated by
water power, as, for instance, in Rome.
</p>

<p>
Restaurants must send to the authorities a list of food furnished, with
prices charged for each portion, or for the whole meal, or for the week. They
must indicate also any extra charges, and the reason for such charges.
The authorities will approve the menu only if it corresponds with normal
or prescribed prices, and a copy, stamped and signed by an authorized
person, must be exposed to the public where it can easily be seen.
</p>

<p>
No food can be served unless it is on the approved list. In large cities,
there is a committee of control, composed of five citizens appointed by
the mayor, whose duty it is to see that the restrictions are rigidly observed.
If the police authorities do not approve of a certain menu, it is submitted
to the committee, and unless they put their O. K. upon it, the restaurant
is not permitted to use it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7'>[7]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Two factors combine to keep prices of necessities
and even luxuries down to a reasonable
level. One is the so-called "<i>calmiere</i>," or government
regulation, that certain products may not
be sold at a higher price than that fixed by the
regularly constituted authorities. The other factor
is the prevalence of co-operative societies that
sell to their members at cost or almost at cost.
Retailers have to compete with these societies, and
there is a consequent curb on profiteering. Nearly
every trade or profession has its own co-operative
stores. The entrance fee which must be paid to join
a co-operative society is very moderate, in some
instances as low as five <i>lire</i> (about one dollar).

Theaters, cinematograph theaters, and other
places of amusement had to close at midnight.

authorities made their own regulations

<p>
In general, theaters and motion-picture
shows in Italy are well patronized.
Opera is still popular, and performances
are given in various cities.
Society does not consider it good
form to wear evening dress. It would
not be in taste for women to be elaborately
gowned, or to attempt to give
dances or house parties. Officers
do not wear their dress
uniforms, no matter what may
be the function they attend.
Ladies avoid the use of jewels,
and there is, generally speaking,
a soberness in the dressing
of both men and women. Italy,
however, is not gloomy nor
depressed. On the contrary,
the Italians are vivacious, and
their sunny dispositions are
manifested throughout the
troublous times.
</p>

<p>
Sports generally have been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8'>[8]</a></span>
abolished. There is no horse-racing, but, for the purpose of breeding fine
animals, horses are still being trained.
</p>

<p>
Travel is freely permitted, though, of course, the war zone has been
carefully guarded. In the restricted area a pass was necessary, and vital
reasons had to be given for permission to travel. On account of the shortage
of coal, the number of trains has been reduced, as well as the number
of cars in each train. Travel is therefore lacking in comfort, and it is not
uncommon to see people standing even in first-class compartments throughout
journeys lasting six or seven hours. The discomforts are accepted
good-naturedly, and there is far less grumbling than one would expect.
</p>

<h3>
<i>Conditions in Venice</i>
</h3>

<p>
The morale of the Italians has never been better. Caporetto has
been avenged, the Austrians were thrown back across the Little Piave,
and brought to their knees. Venice has been saved. The city by the
sea has had its trials. Severe, indeed, have been some of the air raids,
and three-fourths of the population fled. About fifty thousand of
the inhabitants remained, but this represents but one-fourth of the people
that lived along the canals
of Venice before the war.

Many hotels are closed,
tourists come no more. No
Italian city has suffered from
the effects of war so much as
Venice. Industries have been
ruined, its commerce depleted.
Its churches and
hospitals have again and again
been bombed from the air.
Frescoes have been obliterated
that can never be replaced,
though much of the damage
done will soon be repaired.
</p>

<p>
All about the populous
Square of St. Mark heaps of
sand-bags were piled to protect
the arcades. The beautiful
façade of St. Mark's Cathedral
has been, for some time,
hidden from view. The famous
horses were taken down,
the wonderful Byzantine
mosaics were removed, and
the entire front of the building
covered with sand-bags and
protected by huge timbers.

The Doges' (Ducal)
Palace was supported
by columns of bricks;
everywhere evidence
could be seen of the
attempt of the Italians
to save the most remarkable
city in the
world. Inside the
sumptuous Cathedral
of St. Mark's, the effect
was startling&mdash;all the
works of art gone, the
altar covered beyond
recognition, mounds upon mounds of sand-bags heaped around the
columns. It was more like a cave than the interior of one of the most
beautiful of churches. Along the Grand Canal the large hotels have
been converted into hospitals. Vast palaces have been closed and
deserted. Life on the Canal is so quiet that it is almost painful. It is
not the same Venice so many travelers recall. Only one good-class hotel is
open. There are a few boarding-houses, but all the magnificent hotels
are either closed or filled with wounded men.
</p>

<p>
It was difficult in war times to get into Venice, and more difficult
to get out. Everyone was looked upon as a spy until he proved
that he was not. Officials inquired into your life history, traced your
every movement, watched every step you took, and if finally you
passed muster and got away without a long delay, you knew that there
was not a suspicion of your ever having even dreamed of being a spy.

<p>
It was, of course,
more difficult in the war
zone. Once inside the
restricted area one became
a suspect, and it
sometimes took weeks
to obtain police and
military permission to
leave Italy. The Italians
were in earnest,
they had had a severe
lesson, and they did not
intend to be caught
napping.
</p>

<p>
An Allied victory
was the one object,
and Italy was ready
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10'>[10]</a></span>
to pay her share of the price. No
braver men ever faced an enemy
than the Arditi, and no enemy
army ever forgot an encounter
with these "shock troops" of the
Italian army. These men were
born and brought up in an
atmosphere that has taught them
how to fight. They are as hard
as nails, as fearless as lions&mdash;the
pick of Italy's best troops.

<p>
Italy, though needing food, is
not starving, nor is she depressed.
She has recovered from the shock
of 1917, and there is no disaffection
among her people. All are
united. Socialists cannot overturn the conditions of the nation. As for
their military stamina&mdash;Austrians can testify to the fact that the Italian
army is a foe worthy to engage itself at any time, against any hostile power.

"Of all the belligerent nations I have seen, Italy seems to me the most
tranquil, contented and serenely confident. She has endured heavy
losses and is called upon to make great
sacrifices, but her people have counted
the cost and they pay it resolutely,
cheerfully, almost, one would say, gaily.
They have no love for war and on this
one they entered with hesitating and
doubtful steps, but now, I think, they
feel, not only that it was necessary and
right, but that it will give them some
things which were wanting in the years
of peace. War is a monstrous evil; but
from its furnace of pain and suffering
Italy, with other nations, may emerge
hardened and tempered. She will gain a
larger unity and that not merely by annexing
the unredeemed territory. The
war has gone far to obliterate that division
of classes and localities which was the
inheritance of her troubled past. The

"What Italy needs is security, sufficient to
develop to the full her economic resources and
her national individuality; and that she intends
to obtain. She is resolved to be independent of
external patronage, protection and supervision
of any kind, and to enjoy all the rights, privileges,
ambitions, which belong to the greater nations
of the earth. She believes herself capable
of excelling, not merely in art, science, letters,
philosophy, laws, but in production, manufacturing,
commerce, the exploitation of waste and
backward lands. She is not content that her
people, so intelligent, so industrious, so capable,
should be packed off year by year in shoals to form the ill-paid labor
helots of wealthier communities; she prefers that they should be kept at
home to develop the riches and intensified vitality of their own land.
She has watched the rise of Germany from poverty and weakness to
strength and industrial magnificence;
and she believes that the
Latin capacity for organization,
invention, scientific adaptation
and enterprise, is not inferior to
the Teutonic. She thinks she can
do many of the things that Germany
has done, and some things
which Germany will never do; and
she means to try. It is for the
great free nations, with which she
is now associated, to survey her
effort with sympathetic eyes, and
extend to it all the aid and encouragement
in their power."

</p>
</div>
<h2 class="letter"><i>THE OPEN LETTER</i></h2>

<p>
In the coming months of reconstruction
and restoration in Europe, Italy will have
special problems of her own to solve.
Victory in the world war means for Italy
five million additional mouths to feed in
her redeemed territory. Close rationing
will, therefore, be necessary for a long time,
and a liberal food allotment from outside
relief sources must be made.
</p>

<p>
Italy cannot be accused of having neglected
her land. The total area of the
country comprises 70,820,197 acres, only
a little over 7 per cent of which is unproductive
land. In her agricultural production,
however, cereals do not play
an important part. Her wheat product
did not meet her domestic demands even
before the war, and annual importations
of grain were always necessary. The situation,
therefore, today, after the terrible
toll that war has taken, is acute and distressing
as far as the main "staff of life"
is concerned. Italy produces fruits in
quantity, but a starving nation cannot
live by fruit alone. The traveler in Italy
today may feast his eyes on twelve million
acres of vine-covered slopes, but the children
of the land are crying for milk and
bread. The wines of Italy are famous for
their flavor and quality, and her olives
and lemons are known throughout the
world, but the people cannot survive on
wine and olives. They need more substantial
food, and, under the present
strict rationing, each person receives only
seventeen pounds of bread a month.
</p>

<p class="center gesp1">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>
Italy's exports have been chiefly olives,
lemons and cheese&mdash;Gorgonzola and Parmesan
being among the famous brands.
These fine Italian cheeses are made from
goats' milk, and, as there is little enough
of that now to feed wounded soldiers and
children, the exportation of cheese has
been stopped. Before the war olives and
olive oil were shipped in huge quantities.
There are miles and miles of olive trees
to be seen from train windows when
traveling through Italy. Today just as
many olives are grown, and as much olive
oil is obtained, but it is needed at home
and is carefully guarded there. The Italian
government practically controls the output
and very little is permitted for export.
Lemons are grown in great quantities and
are still exported to some extent. The
difficulty in obtaining boats, however, has
made it impossible to ship any considerable
quantity of lemons, and so this source
of income has been virtually eliminated.
</p>

<p class="center gesp1">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>
Italy has found it necessary, therefore,
to cultivate her products exclusively for
home consumption, and, in this cultivation,
thought is given only to the supply
of things necessary for the maintenance
of the Italian people. Things that are
most needed,&mdash;that give most sustenance,
are being cultivated to the exclusion of
things that brought income from outside,
but did not fill the hungry mouths of the
people. Also, food products that formerly
had to be imported, are now being
home grown. Fortunately, this is made
easy by the fact that Italy is a "clime
where every season smiles." It is favored
by climatic conditions to a degree comparable
to those of Southern California,
and, accordingly, a great range of crops,
both of a temperate-zone and of a tropical
kind, can be grown readily. In the
southern part of Italy the climate is semitropical.
The soil is fertile and garden-truck
grows in abundance&mdash;and many
kinds of fruit, including oranges, lemons,
grapes, apples, plums and pears. In the
fertile plains of the north are fields where
cereals are grown and these are being extended
and prepared for intensified cultivation.
The delta of the Piave, captured
and held for a short time by the Austrians,
is again in possession of Italy. Comprising
some of the richest soil in the world, it
will soon be flourishing with growing crops,
and its fields will contribute substantially
to the solution of Italy's food problem.
</p>

<p class="center gesp1">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>
We may be sure then that Italy, plucky
and staunch, will "carry on" through hardship
to renewed prosperity. With the
sympathetic assistance that is her due
from the United States, there can be no
question of the future. Italy's firmly
booted leg will continue to kick its sturdy
way down into the "warm waters" that
Germany so desired; her fair domains will
continue to enjoy that "place in the sun"
that Prussia so imperiously demanded.
With all her advantages of land and sea,
Italy must "come through" and find
plenty in the wake
of peace.

<p><span class="smcap">The Mentor</span> receives friendly messages from its readers daily, and, at
the turn of the New Year, many cordial greetings come in&mdash;for all of
which thanks! full hearted and fervent thanks! These messages are a
great encouragement and inspiration to us. With such endorsement
of past accomplishment we look to the future with joyful confidence.
The shortest, pithiest, and most expressive message that we have
received came over the phone one morning not many days ago: "I
like The Mentor because it is absolutely unique. The Mentor has a
genius for <i>making knowledge human</i>." Think of it, making knowledge
human! That is a new phrase, and it pleases us mightily. To many people, knowledge,
while much desired and sought after, presents an imposing and awesome front.
To many, knowledge means toilsome and tedious study. If The Mentor has succeeded
in making the halls and chambers in the Temple of Knowledge bright, sunny, and
attractive; if it has made the pathways in the fields of research alluring and easy to
pursue&mdash;in brief, if, as our reader says, it has "made knowledge human,"&mdash;we shall
feel that we have accomplished something well worth while.
</p>

<p class="p2">
From far out in Montana a doctor writes to us: "I was glad to get your letter
today as a reminder. I have missed The Mentor since my membership ran out. I've
been lonesome without it. If you have any rates for five years or so, let me know,
and I'll take advantage of them. I want it to belong to our family from now on. The
Mentor will never get old, and my growing family will appreciate it in ten years from now
as much as my wife and I do now. I do not know you people who get out this magazine,
and probably never will, but please take this note as a whole-hearted appreciation."
</p>

<p class="p2">
From Winnipeg the head of a prominent insurance company greets us as follows:
"I want again to congratulate you on the very high standard maintained in every
number issued. I certainly enjoy reading The Mentor and the beautiful pictures
accompanying each issue are most delightful. I simply cannot speak too highly of
the merits of your excellent publication."
</p>

<p class="p2">
Another message comes from Quebec. A member of our Association, with the
fine old French-Canadian name of Gaston Beaupré, writes to us: "Allow me to congratulate
you for your service to me since I joined Mentor Association. It is needless
to tell you how much I appreciate my Mentors. I am looking forward to our dreaded
and cold Canadian winter evenings without fear since I have plenty of Mentors to
while away the time. The loneliest country in the world is lovely enough for me if I
have a few copies of Mentor with me."
</p>

<p class="p2">
A well-wishing friend out in middle Pennsylvania, carrying out what seemed to
be a New Year's resolution, sent us this greeting: "I have intended for a long time to
write you a personal letter telling you of my appreciation of The Mentor. It has
seemed to me to be the one place of resort where I could find enjoyment and forget
for awhile. The Mentor is indeed a <i>real part of my life</i>. I should like to drop in and
visit you at the home of The Mentor."
</p>

<p>
By all means "drop in." The latchstring of The Mentor door is always loose
and a warm welcome within awaits every member of The Mentor Association. If you
are ever in New York, come in and visit us so that we may come to know each other well.

The beautiful numbers of the unique
Mentor Library will never be out of
date, as every issue of The Mentor
is devoted to an important subject of
enduring interest. The concise form
in which scores of subjects are covered
makes it of the greatest practical
value to the business man, to the
active woman who appreciates the
importance of being well informed,
and to children, who will find it of
great direct value in their school
work. <b>You will want volume Number
Six, which will complete The Mentor
